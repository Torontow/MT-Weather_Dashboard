## The Project

PLEASE NOTE: This is project remains a work in progress. 

The client requested a weather dashboard that will allow them find details about the current weather and 5-day forecast for a selected city.

## The Process

I began by trying to build the site dynamically, but then decided that there weren't enough "moving parts" to the project to warrant the complication, so I rebuilt it with a hard-coded HTML with dynamically updated portions based on user input.

While there is currently some functionality to the site (clicking on a city in the preset search field produces a result), much of the functionality has yet to be built.

## Installation

Simply navigate to the site URL: "https://torontow.github.io/MT-Weather_Dashboard"

## Usage

When the page loads, the user is meant to be asked for permission to use their location so that their current weather and forecast are displayed first. 

The user has the option of entering a city to search, or clicking from a list of popular choices in Canada and around the world. Either method will display the same weather information as before for the chosen city.
